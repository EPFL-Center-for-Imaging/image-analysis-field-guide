# Roadmap

We are planning to improve the `Image Analysis Field Guide` in the following ways:

- Use an open-source solution to replace `Notion` as a collaborative database.
- Add video recordings to the short guides.
- Use *Large Language Models* to extract and save tags from online resources and the documentation of software tools.
- Suggest a **Learning Curriculum** that will present online resources, demonstrate the use of software tools, and showcase case studies in a logical order.
