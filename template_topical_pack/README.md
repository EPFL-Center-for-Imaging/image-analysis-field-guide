# üç™ Cookiecutter - New topical pack

Use this cookiecutter to generate a new topical pack to add to our list.

The cookiecutter will

- Generate a template folder with a pre-filled `index.md`, an `images/` and a `notebooks/` directories.
- Move this folder to `src/sections/` where all the topical packs are.
- Add a line to `_src/toc.yml` to reference the topical pack in the table of contents.

You will be asked to provide your **name** and **email**, and some basic information on your topical pack (that you can edit later). 

Once you've created your topical pack, you can for example
- Edit your topical pack's `index.md` to your liking, and find a nice `header.jpeg` image.
- Tag *software tools* and *online resources* with your chosen tag in the Notion databases so that they appear on your page when the site gets rebuilt.
- Commit your changes and make a **Pull Request** to the main repository.
