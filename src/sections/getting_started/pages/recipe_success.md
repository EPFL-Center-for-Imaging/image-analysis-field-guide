# ✅ A recipe for success in image analysis

To be on your way to solving your image analysis problem, we recommend asking yourself the following questions.

```{admonition} Understand the data, goals, and constraints of your project
:class: tip
It's important to make sure that your project specifications are clear. To help you focus on the right things, download and use our template: **[✏️ Image analysis project sheet](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NUFKOpXunjs9hOxmn5RvLNrfcF0DhXfgoVGIL3-eXiA/edit?usp=sharing)**.
```

```{admonition} Identify the right terminology for your problem
:class: tip
Finding keywords that match your problem will make it easier for you to review the literature and to communicate what you are trying to accomplish.

A good starting point:

```

```{admonition} Look for existing tools that might help
:class: tip
There is no point reinventing the wheel! Search for software, libraries, or plugins that could help you solve your image analysis problem in our curated list: [Software tools](https://www.notion.so/Software-tools-af90da3522de4a34bc5246cc59c7efbf?pvs=21).
```

```{admonition} Identify the simplest possible approach that might work and try it first
:class: tip
Sometimes, simple approaches are good enough. If not, the performance of simple algorithms will at least give you a baseline for comparison.

```{admonition} Track your progress and conclude when the results are “good enough”
:class: tip
Developing a functional image analysis solution can be a lot of work. Celebrate each small incremental achievement that you make!

 ```{admonition} Seek feedback from others
 :class: tip
Make sure that there are people around you who understand what you are working on and are available to give you feedback and suggestions.
