# The image analysis field guide

**Essential toolkit to get started in scientific image analysis.**

Welcome! Use this field guide to quickly find the information you need to tackle your scientific image analysis challenges.

## 🔖 Getting started

New to image analysis? These **short guides** will help you start off on the right foot.

- [🐍 Setting up Python for scientific image analysis](./sections/getting_started/pages/python_setup.md)
<!-- - [🚩 Starting a new image analysis project](./sections/getting_started/pages/new_project.md) -->

These are our favourite **resources** for learning the basics of image analysis:
